# Portfolio

## Name of Application

The name of my application is "Portfolio" which contains a collection of information about me and how to contact me.

## Link to my app

[Portfolio](https://amerkulovic.github.io/portfolio/)

## Purpose

The purpose of my portfolio is to allow any potential employers, to look at it and get a better general understanding of who I am and what I have accomplished.

## My Experience

I had a fun time creating and styling my portfolio. One of the greatest challenges I faced when making this portfolio is using the media query and flex-box. I made sure to google any questions I had and seeked tutoring from my instructors and TA's alongside the tutoring session to make sure I applied those applications correctly to my portfolio.
